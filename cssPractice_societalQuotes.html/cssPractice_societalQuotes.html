            "Society as a whole benifits immeasurably from a climate in which all persons,
            regardless of race or gender, may have the opportunity to earn respect,
            responsibility, advancement and remuneration based on <span class="strike-through">
            inheritance </span> ability."

            "Shall i not inform you of a better act than fasting, alms, and prayers? Making
            peace between one another: enmity and malice tear up heavenly rewards by the

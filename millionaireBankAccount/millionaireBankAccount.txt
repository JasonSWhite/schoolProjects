Bank Balance - Millionaire Savings Account

The First National Bank of Parkville recently opened up a new 
“So You Want to Be a Millionaire” savings account. The new 
account works as follows:

-The bank doubles the customer’s balance every year until the 
customer’s balance reaches one million.
-The customer isn’t allowed to touch the money (no deposits or 
withdrawals) until the customer’s balance reaches one million. 
If the customer dies before becoming a millionaire, the bank keeps 
the customer’s balance.
-Note:Customers close to $1,000,000 tend to get “accidentally” run 
over in the bank’s parking lot.

Write a program that prompts the user for a starting balance and 
then prints the number of years it takes to reach $100,000 and also 
the number of years it takes to reach $1,000,000.

Sample session:

Enter starting balance: 10000
It takes 4 years to reach $100,000.
It takes 7 years to reach $1,000,000.
